### Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This code snippet defines the `csf_tz` application, a Frappe/ERPNext app that utilizes monkey patching to modify core Frappe functionality. The app is designed to enhance or alter existing functionality by overriding specific methods and injecting custom logic. 

### Module Structure <a name="module-structure"></a>

#### App Installation  <a name="app-installation"></a>

*   **`__version__`**: Defines the version of the `csf_tz` app.
*   **`app_name`**: Stores the name of the app as `csf_tz`.
*   **`patches_loaded`**: A flag that indicates whether monkey patches have been applied. This flag is set to `False` by default.

#### Monkey Patches <a name="monkey-patches"></a>

*   **`load_monkey_patches()`**: This function loads all modules present in the `monkey_patches` directory within the app. It ensures that patches are loaded only once per app installation. 
    *   The function iterates through all files in the `monkey_patches` directory and imports them dynamically. 
    *   If a file does not end with `.py` or is named `__init__.py`, it is skipped.

#### Hooks <a name="hooks"></a>

*   **`old_get_hooks`**: Stores a reference to the original `frappe.get_hooks` function, which is used to retrieve hooks defined in Frappe apps.
*   **`get_hooks()`**: This function overrides the `frappe.get_hooks` function. It first ensures that the monkey patches have been loaded by calling `load_monkey_patches()` and then calls the original `frappe.get_hooks` function to return the hook data.

#### Database Connection <a name="database-connection"></a>

*   **`old_connect`**: Stores a reference to the original `frappe.connect` function, which is used to establish a connection to the Frappe database.
*   **`connect()`**: This function overrides the `frappe.connect` function. It first calls the original `frappe.connect` function to establish the connection and then calls `load_monkey_patches()` to apply the monkey patches once the connection is established.

#### Console Output <a name="console-output"></a>

*   **`console()`**: This function sends data to the Frappe console using the `frappe.publish_realtime` method. 
    *   The `out_to_console` event is used to publish the data.
    *   The current user's session is used as the target user.
    *   This function provides a mechanism for developers to display output directly in the Frappe console.

**Example Usage**

The `csf_tz` app modifies Frappe behavior by overriding functions like `frappe.get_hooks` and `frappe.connect`. This approach allows developers to extend or customize Frappe functionality without directly altering the core Frappe code.
